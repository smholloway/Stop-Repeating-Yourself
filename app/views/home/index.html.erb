<h1>English is a Global Language</h1>
<div>
One of the most important skills successful professionals, academics, entrepreneurs, or politicians posses is the ability to communicate effectively. English is a global language which is proliferating rapidly; however, the ability to productively speak the language, and thus communicate effectively, is not keeping pace. An implicit assumption to effective communication is that your message can be easily understood and convincingly conveyed. Many of us have had memorable experiences with outsourced tech support, or a non-native Teaching Assistant- with the help of Project Speak Easy this will soon be the exception and not the rule.  We aim to provide English language pronunciation and accent modification services to non-native English speakers who are hindered by a current lack of understandability or an unorthodox communication style. What differentiates our approach to this industry is not only the flexibility of our eLearning delivery format but the personalized learning plans and automated technology suite, as well as the innate scalability of our approach. Using proven linguistic, educational psychology, intercultural communication techniques we can provide customized learning solutions that increase communication effectiveness so our clients can reach their social, economic, and professional goals.
